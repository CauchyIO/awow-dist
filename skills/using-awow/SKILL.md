description: "The awow operating reflex — the compact bootstrap injected at the start of every session by the awow plugin's SessionStart hook. Defines the proactive board-linkage reflex (go to the board before any initiative; carry the hygiene call yourself; link with no ceremony), the proposal-first and approval-before-write rules, and the command catalog the agent reaches for. Read or invoke this to recall how awow expects an agent to work; the full team-specific conventions live in the repo's agent instructions (AGENTS.md)."

# You are working in an awow repo

awow — the Agentic Way of Working — moves the discipline of keeping the board and the knowledge current into the *session itself*, not the human. The board is the single source of truth for planning; context lives in the code, not a wiki. Your job is to keep that true as a byproduct of the work in front of you — never as a chore deferred to the end.

This is the reflex. The team's full conventions, mission, and board spec live in the repo's agent instructions (`AGENTS.md`) and `{HUB}/context/` — read them when you need the specifics.

## Where the paths point

Paths here never hardcode a location — they use four tokens. **In this repo, and in any vendored or plugin install, `{HUB}` and `{PROJECT}` both resolve to the repo root and `{AWOW_TOOLS}` to awow's bundled tools** — so `{HUB}/context/tooling/board.md` is the board pointer read at that path under the root. `{AWOW_ROOT}` is awow's own machinery: the repo root here, the plugin payload in a plugin install.

**Machinery reads `{HUB}` first, then `{AWOW_ROOT}`** — a team that vendored and edited a contract beats the shipped default. Team data (mission, members, conventions, style, `board.md`, `architecture.md`) is `{HUB}` only.

In a hub-connected spoke, a hub pointer tells you where `{HUB}` resolves instead. If `{HUB}` is ever unresolvable, stop and say so — never guess a location or improvise a convention. **An absent file is not an unresolvable `{HUB}`.** A missing `board.md` means ask once (below), not halt.

## Go to the board before any initiative

Before you start work with a discernible outcome — a bug, a feature, a refactor, anything that would warrant a commit — go to the board first.

- **Look first.** Read `{HUB}/context/tooling/board.md` for the board pointer and read/write surface, then search for an existing ticket covering the scope. If one exists, use it; do not duplicate.
- **No match? Propose, then create.** Draft the issue under `{PROJECT}/proposals/` first, get approval, then create it on the board.
- **Move state and comment as you go.** Move to "In progress" when you start; comment on blockers and findings; close when the change lands. Never a silent state change.

Gated to *initiatives*, not every edit. A grep, a clarifying answer, a one-line typo fix the user named — no ticket. Rule of thumb: would a teammate reasonably expect to find this on the board next week? If yes, ticket; if no, just do it.

## Carry the hygiene decision yourself

Apply that rule of thumb *proactively*. Do not bounce it back as "shall I make an issue for this?" — make the call, act, and report what you did in one line. Read what the work *is* from the conversation, not from the current branch. Link to an existing item with no ceremony ("tracking this under AWOW-42"); reserve approval for *creating* a new item. As work lands, move state and drop a one-line comment unprompted.

## Draft first, land second

Iterate on the cheap artefact. A markdown file under `{PROJECT}/proposals/` is free; the board, the knowledge base, and `AGENTS.md` are expensive to change well. Never write directly to the board, the team context, or the knowledge base without human approval. Story bodies carry intent + acceptance criteria + a knowledge-base link — nothing more; status and findings go in comments; durable rationale goes in `{HUB}/context/knowledge-base/`.

## Reach for the commands

awow ships the loop as commands and skills — prefer them over improvising:

- `/setup-awow` — bootstrap or extend awow in this repo.
- `/process-workitem` — take a board item from refinement to PR.
- `/refinement-prep` — draft a feature for the next refinement.
- `/daily-checkin` — map your day to the board and execute approved updates.
- `/project-manager` — run the delivery coordination loop.
- `/project-plan` — turn a locked design into a published plan.

Invoke the relevant one before hand-rolling the same workflow. The full catalog is the awow command set (vendored: `.agents/commands/`; plugin installs: the awow plugin's commands).

## When an inner-loop engine is present

If a build engine (superpowers, spec-kit) is installed, its lifecycle skills *are* your board cues: `brainstorming` is a board moment, `verification-before-completion` gates In Review/Done, `finishing-a-development-branch` closes the ticket. Bind each transition to the skill that already fires at it — see `board-aware-development` for the full crosswalk. When the repo declares an architecture plane in `{PROJECT}/context/tooling/architecture.md`, those same lifecycle skills are also your *architecture* cues — see `architecture-aware-development` for that crosswalk. Working directly (outside `/process-workitem`), keep the board current as you fire those skills; the PreToolUse hook reminds you, but the discipline is yours.

No engine installed? awow runs on its baseline board discipline alone — nothing here misfires. superpowers is the recommended optional engine for the build step; offer it via `/setup-awow` (Step 8, surface the extras), never force it.

## A missing board pointer is a question, not a stop

If `{HUB}/context/tooling/board.md` is absent, infer the board from the git remote — a GitHub remote means GitHub Issues via `gh`. If it cannot be inferred, ask once which board they use and how to reach it, and hold the answer for the session. Do not halt, and do not ask again. Offer `/setup-awow` Step 1 to make it durable.

Do not guess a board from a GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps remote — those map to several products; ask. If there is no remote, or `gh` is absent or unauthenticated, ask and do not offer the `gh` path.

This covers an absent pointer only. A fatal auth failure on a data source still stops the run — never synthesise from a half-snapshot.

## Catch the rules people say in passing

When someone states how the team works — not what to do next — that is a convention with nowhere to live yet. Test it: after doing exactly what was asked, does anything remain that would change your behaviour in an unrelated session next week, and can you write it as "when X, do Y" without naming this file or this ticket? If yes to both, and they asserted it rather than floated it, and it binds the team rather than describing the world (facts belong in the knowledge base) — note it in one line inside the reply you were already writing.

Do not interrupt to ask. At a completion edge — a commit, a PR, "that's it for today" — offer the batch once via `/update-context`. Once per session, never mid-task. Scoping words ("here", "for this one", "just this time") mean it is not a convention. If `/update-context` is not available in this repo, stay silent. If they decline with "stop asking", write `.awow/no-context-prompt` and stay silent for good.
