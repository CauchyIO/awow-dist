# Azure DevOps — hierarchy reference

ADO enforces a strict four-level hierarchy through its work-item-type schema.

| Concept | ADO primitive | What belongs here |
|---|---|---|
| L1 — Strategic goal | Epic | Multi-quarter outcome. |
| L2 — Capability | Feature | Quarter-scale chunk. Has a single owner. |
| L3 — Deliverable (agent-pickable story) | User Story (Agile) / Product Backlog Item (Scrum) | Days to a week. Has acceptance criteria. |
| L4 — Action | Task | Hours. Optional; only when decomposition is useful. |

ADO is the most opinionated of the supported boards — the hierarchy is enforced by the schema, not by convention.

> **Planning vocabulary.** Quarter planning speaks tool-agnostically in **outcome → epic → feature → story** — and names who sets each level — in `context/quarterly/README.md` and `/refinement-prep`. The same word sits at a different level on each board (here "Epic" is L1 and "Feature" is L2, so the planning "epic" and "feature" land one level higher than on Linear), so map those concepts onto the primitives above with the team rather than assuming a shared meaning.

## Rules

- Tasks **cannot** be promoted to standalone User Stories. If a Task is growing acceptance criteria, the agent proposes splitting it into a sibling User Story under the parent Feature.
- Every User Story must have an **Area Path** and an **Iteration Path** set. The agent refuses to pick up an Issue with no Iteration Path.
- Epics live in the Portfolio Backlog; the agent does not create or move Epics autonomously.

## Wizard responsibilities

**Mode A (from reference).** Confirm the team uses Epic / Feature / User Story / Task. Ask for one or two example Epic names so the agent has a vocabulary anchor. Tell the user the agent only creates User Stories or Tasks autonomously.

**Mode B (assess current).** Read the actual hierarchy in use. Surface anything unusual: Tasks with acceptance criteria, User Stories without parent Features, missing Iteration Paths.

## What lands in `board.md`

```
## Hierarchy

- L1 (Epic): example names: <…>
- L2 (Feature): in use, <N> active.
- L3 (User Story / PBI): agent-pickable level.
- L4 (Task): used for <hourly decomposition | not used>.

Divergence from reference: <none | list>.
